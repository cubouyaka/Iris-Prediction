# Iris-Prediction
PREDICTION OF SPECIES OF IRIS FLOWER USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION

The Iris dataset is load from sklearn.datasets lib but can be found here 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris'


1. Load the datas in a DataFrame (pandas)
2. Split the dataset into 70% training and 30% testing sets
3. rain a logistic regression model on the training set
4. Evaluate the accuracy of the model on the testing set
5. Use k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model
6. Calculate and print evaluation metrics
7. Create a confusion matrix for the model and print it
